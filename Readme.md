# Python Packages

This repository contains any program or script I was not incredibly embarrased about, that might prove useful to others.

## TLWANSTAT

This is a console script that will return information of the wan devices on a TP-Link TD-W9970 router.

I created it when my ISP was doing maintenance on my line at the same time I was doing maintenance on other servers. To make sure I knew the connection issues were from my isp, I made this to login and scrape my wan device status

Would like to put the routers into the script as classes which would add a "plugin" like ability for others.
